-Top level tags inside <body> should be sections
-When duplicating an element, use a class name on that element and style all subcomponents relative to that classname
  (i.e. .profile h2 { font-size: 1rem; })
  This way when you duplicate the element you won't have to change styles in two places

-Start with mobile

-Use multiple columns in a row with width = 12 instead of multiple rows
