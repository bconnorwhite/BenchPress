BenchPress

----------
TODO:
----------
Extract real theme name from domain

For multiple header/footers, move header/footer code to section-templates, use different includes in each page template

Add documentation for how to use here:
-HTML classes
-SCSS framework
-WP Install

OOP-ify benchpress.php, use includes to clean up

Rename variables/consts, don't just call everything output...
