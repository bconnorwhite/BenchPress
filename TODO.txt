Bugs:

Next:
-KHA test
-Plus/clone button to add new repeating element

=> Dock Essence Editor toolbar to top of the screen? Otherwise set left offset
+ If no inner tags don't newline content

-----
BENCHPRESS
-----
+Instead of an array of fields & array of groups, just build groups with fields nested like acf does w/Export
	- This will make it easier to add new fields, since they won't be numbered 300 or whatever
	- Also, don't number them, just list
	- Also figure out best way to edit a site after using BenchPress. ACF UI?
+If bg and field, add a bg image button to editor toolbar


=> Globals (matching id + structure across pages) - look at options acf add-on
	-Basically just make section with the id container using a global group, add pages as necessary to acf.php
